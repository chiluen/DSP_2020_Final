{"business": ["The US Defense Department on Thursday added nine Chinese firms, including Xiaomi, to a list of companies the agency claims are owned or controlled by China's military. Businesses on the list are subject to harsh restrictions, including a ban on American investment. The addition is worrisome news for Xiaomi, which recently surpassed Apple (AAPL) to become the world's third largest smartphone maker, according to market intelligence firm IDC. The company's stock plunged more than 10% in Hong Kong on Friday.  The Pentagon's list also included the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), a major, state-owned Chinese plane maker that the country wants to build up as an alternative to Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSF). The Defense Department said in a statement that it is \"determined to highlight and counter\" the relationship between China's military and firms that \"appear to be civilian entities\" but which support the military with advanced technology and expertise. Beijing on Friday blasted the new restrictions as an abuse of power by the United States. American industry has a \"long history\" of civil-military relationships, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters at a regular press briefing, accusing the Trump administration of \"double standards\" and \"bullying.\" The US Commerce Department also put CNOOC, China's largest offshore oil producer, on another list that effectively cuts it off from American supplies and technology. The company was already on the Defense Department's list.  \"CNOOC acts as a bully for the People's Liberation Army to intimidate China's neighbors,\" said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement, referring to the country's military. His agency claimed that CNOOC has been harassing and threatening offshore oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea by other countries, such as Vietnam. Xiaomi denied it was owned or controlled by the Chinese military in a stock exchange filing.  \"The company confirms that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a 'Communist Chinese Military Company' defined under the [National Defense Authorization Act],\" it said in the statement. Xiaomi added that it will \"take appropriate course of actions\" to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders.  CNN Business has also reached out to CNOOC, Comac and other companies added to the US government lists on Thursday, but has yet to receive a response.  The moves are the latest in a slew of actions the Trump administration has taken against Beijing in the weeks leading up to Biden's inauguration, and could complicate US-China relations for the incoming government.  \"The new administration will likely not be as belligerent but may also not be as willing to unwind Trump-era policies as many might hope,\" Jeffrey Halley, senior market strategist for Asia Pacific at Oanda, wrote in a research note on Friday. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the performance of Chinese tech stocks, fell 1.4%. Xiaomi was the worst performer on the index on Friday.   The ban will cause \"immediate selling pressure\" on Xiaomi's stock, but will have little impact on the company's operations, analysts from Citi said in a research report on Friday. Before Thursday, the Pentagon had already added 35 Chinese companies to its military list, including chipmaker SMIC and tech firm Huawei. The Commerce Department has also imposed restrictions on many companies. (SMIC has denied that it has a relationship with the Chinese military, while Huawei has denied various US allegations that it poses a risk to national security.) The New York Stock Exchange also announced last week that it would delist three Chinese telecom company stocks to comply with US President Donald Trump's executive order banning American investment in certain companies.", "Pinduoduo (PDD) \u2014 the country's third largest e-commerce firm after Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) \u2014 became a target of public outrage after two of its employees unexpectedly died during the holiday season. First, a worker in her twenties collapsed in Urumqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang region, while walking home with colleagues during the early hours of Dec. 29. The company confirmed her death, but did not disclose the cause. Then, another worker died late last week after jumping from his 27-floor apartment in Changsha, a city in the southern Hunan province. Pinduoduo said the man had earlier asked for time off, without giving a reason, according to a company statement. \"We feel profound sadness that we lost one of our employees to suicide,\" the company said in the statement. \"We are doing everything we can to support his family and loved ones during this difficult time.\"   Chinese social media users had already started calling out the deaths as emblematic of a troublesome work culture at Pinduoduo when a former software engineer at the company catapulted awareness of the problem to new highs. In a 15-minute video published Sunday on Weibo that garnered millions of likes and thousands of comments, the user Wang Taixu claimed that Pinduoduo fired him after he posted a photo he said showed an ambulance taking away another company employee.  (Wang is his surname, and he goes by the nickname \"Taixu\" on Weibo and used that name during his time at Pinduoduo.) In additional posts on Weibo and other Chinese social media platforms, Wang accused the company of forcing workers at its Shanghai headquarters to work in excess of 300 hours per month, and not providing enough toilets for its employees. \"I don't think the world should work this way,\" Wang said in the video. He described Pinduoduo as a company that \"forces the smartest people in the country to work\" long hours, and expressed his disappointment that the stock has been trading at record levels on Wall Street despite the recent controversies. Pinduoduo denied that Wang was fired because of the photo he posted, telling CNN Business that his termination was due to \"extreme comments\" he made on social media with \"notable ill intentions,\" in violation of the company's rules. The company didn't respond to questions about the allegations made against its work culture. It did say, however, that it has set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of its worker last week. Tech work culture under fire  The firestorm surrounding Pinduoduo has reignited a long-running debate in China about the tech industry's controversial \"996\" work culture \u2014 a term referring to the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week that is said to be common among the country's big technology companies and startups. Public backlash against the practice isn't new. Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, for example, was heavily criticized in China two years ago after he called 996 culture a \"huge blessing.\"  But this latest fallout comes at a precarious time for China's tech titans, which are facing intense regulatory scrutiny, including accusations that some of them are putting profits above their customers and crowding out competition. Ma himself hasn't been seen in public for months as Alibaba faces an antitrust investigation and its financial affiliate, Ant Group, has been ordered to overhaul its operations. \"The sad death of employees at Pinduoduo provides Beijing with timely and very visceral publicity which it can leverage to further its policy objectives,\" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore. \"The message: the Pinduoduo tragedy is another lesson about what happens when private companies put their own business priorities ahead of the [ruling Chinese Communist Party].\" Chinese state media has picked up on the recent controversies, further suggesting that the government is willing to stoke criticism of these tech companies. (Such outlets are a powerful tool in the country's propaganda machine, and they are often looked upon as barometers of sentiment among senior officials.) \"People are concerned about the matter [the sudden death of the Pinduoduo employee] because they feel the pain of abnormal overtime work culture,\" read an unbylined commentary piece published on Weibo last week by the state-owned Xinhua News Agency. The article added that workers' rights and interests must be strengthened.  Xinhua interviewed Wang, the former Pinduoduo worker, on Tuesday. He told the publication that while his remarks were drastic, he did not regret publishing his photo. \"It is the Chinese government which allowed Wang Taixu's video to be so widely circulated and generate such heated discussions,\" said Jack Qiu Linchuan, professor of communications at the National University of Singapore and an expert on Chinese labor issues. \"One of the fundamental reasons for the huge public backlash is that the government did not censor it, despite having the full ability to do so.\" Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital who is based in Hong Kong, also said the recent backlash against the 996 culture appeared to carry \"political overtones.\" \"Beijing is busily trying to assert new levels of control upon tech giants and their massively wealthy leaders. Recent worker tragedies at Pinduoduo have provided those authorities with another potential arrow in their quiver,\" Silvers said. He added, though, that the environment for workers might not change much, even after the tech sector \"regains a regulator equilibrium.\" \"Ambitious workers looking for better lives will likely still be toiling under the influence of 996,\" Silvers said.

It was revealed in a new report from the BBC and IPVM, an independent group which monitors video surveillance technology. A Huawei spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business that the company would \"amend\" its patent, adding that the ethnicity identification feature should \"never have become part of the application.\" \"Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are continuously working to ensure new and evolving technology is developed and applied with the utmost care and integrity.\" The use of facial recognition technology in policing and domestic security is widespread across China but especially in the western region of Xinjiang, where up to 2 million people from Uyghur and other ethnic Muslim minorities have allegedly been put into internment camps, according to the US State Department. Beijing maintains that the camps are vocational training centers that help to deradicalize citizens. But Uyghur exiles have described the crackdown as \"cultural genocide,\" with former detainees saying they were indoctrinated and abused. IPVM political director Conor Healy said that Huawei needed to explain why the feature had been part of the patent application in the first place.  \"What possible reason could there be that they would go file patents and develop a facial recognition system that literally involves hours and hours of training a computer to detect what race somebody is?\" he told CNN Business. \"There are very few uses for that kind of technology that benefit humanity.\" Huawei wasn't the only company that IPVM said had filed this kind of patent. According to IPVM, Chinese tech startup Megvii submitted a patent application in June 2019 for a system which mentioned an \"ethnicity classification\" that would include \"Han, Uyghur, non-Han, non-Uyghur and unknown.\" In a statement to CNN Business, Megvii said that it would \"withdraw\" the 2019 patent application, which it said was \"open to misunderstanding.\" \"Megvii has not developed and will not develop or sell racial or ethnic labelling solutions,\" the statement said. IPVM also found another Chinese tech startup, Sensetime, mentioned in a patent application in July 2019 that it could identify people by ethnicity, specifically singling out \"Uyghur\" as a possibility.  Sensetime told CNN Business that the reference to Uyghurs was \"regrettable,\" adding that it was \"one of the examples within the application intended to illustrate the attributes the algorithm recognizes.\"  \"It was neither designed nor intended in any way to discriminate, which is against our values,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"We will update the patent at the next available opportunity.\" IPVM's report is the latest in a series of revelations about the questionable facial recognition practices of Chinese technology giants. In December, Alibaba (BABA) said that it would no longer try to identify faces by ethnicity after IPVM reported that a division of the company had shown clients how their facial recognition system could detect Uyghurs. In the same month, the Washington Post alleged that Huawei had tested facial recognition software capable of sending automatic \"Uyghur alarms\" to government authorities if a member of the ethnic minority was detected by its camera systems. At the time, Huawei had denied that it would \"develop or sell systems that identify people by their ethnic group.\"  \"We do not condone the use of our technologies to discriminate against or oppress members of any community,\" the company said in a statement posted to its website. The latest report comes as governments around the world are increasingly pressuring companies whose products may be linked to alleged forced labor camps in Xinjiang. On Wednesday, the US government announced that it would ban all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang. One day earlier the UK government declared that it would fine companies that hid economic connections to Xinjiang, as the government attempted to crack down on products of forced labor entering the country. In analysis written for its latest report, IPVM said that the inclusion of Uyghur tracking in the patent applications for top China tech companies showed \"how prevalent this racist technology is\" in the country. \"This is a clear example of People's Republic of China's human rights abuse against Uyghur people, and also represents a long-term risk for the broader video surveillance industry's reputation,\" IPVM said. -- Michelle Toh contributed to this report."], "health": ["Air passengers will be required to get a viral test within three days before their flight to the United States departs, and to provide written documentation of their lab results, or documentation of having recovered from Covid-19, the agency said in a statement to CNN.  CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield is expected to sign the order on Tuesday and it will go into effect on January 26.  \"Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus continue to emerge in countries around the world, and there is evidence of increased transmissibility of some of these variants,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"With the US already in surge status, the testing requirement for air passengers will help slow the spread of the virus as we work to vaccinate the American public.\" If a passenger does not provide documentation of a negative test or recovery, or chooses not to take a test, the airline must not allow the passenger to board, the CDC said.  \"Testing does not eliminate all risk, but when combined with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations,\" Redfield said in the statement. The new variant of coronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible, has already been found in at least 10 states in samples dating back to mid-December. An airline industry group has expressed support for the new measure.  \"[We are] writing to express our support for a [CDC] proposal to control the spread of COVID-19, including variants of the virus, by implementing a global program to require testing for travelers to the United States,\" the industry group Airlines for America wrote to Vice President Mike Pence on January 4.  The new rule is similar to one put in place last month for passengers from the UK to the US, which requires that passengers have a negative test within three days of boarding their flight. For the UK requirement that went through last month, airlines can be subject to criminal penalties if they fail to comply, and passengers can be subject to criminal penalties if they willfully give false or misleading information.    The earlier requirement for UK travelers was a response to a new coronavirus variant that was identified in the UK. While the variant appears to spread more easily, there's no evidence that it's any more deadly or causes more severe disease, according to CDC.  At least 72 cases of a variant first identified in the UK have been found in 10 US states, according to data posted Monday by the CDC. That includes at least 32 cases in California, 22 cases in Florida, five cases in Minnesota, four cases in New York, three cases in Colorado, two cases in Connecticut, and one case each in Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Georgia. The variant has been identified in dozens of countries worldwide.", "The Trump administration plans to release reserved second doses immediately, a senior administration official tells CNN. The official expects reserved doses to be distributed over the next two weeks.  The move comes after Trump administration officials recently disparaged Biden's plan to do the same. \"If President-elect Biden is calling for the distribution of vaccines knowing that there would not be a second dose available, that decision is without science or data and is contrary to the FDA's approved label,\" Operation Warp Speed spokesman Michael Pratt said Friday in light of Biden's announcement. \"If President-elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening.\" The new plan would also change guidelines to allow vaccinations immediately for anyone anyone 65 and older and would help states set up mass vaccination sites should they request assistance. The administration wants to shift focus away from hospitals and focus more on adding more accessible venues, such as pharmacies, the source said. This will attempt to address a reoccurring issue states have faced in trying to administer the vaccine through hospitals and medical providers that have said they don't have the resources or personnel to serve as vaccination clinics. The Trump administration which had previously balked at releasing all available doses.  Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines require two rounds of injection, and while releasing nearly all vaccine doses on hand could quickly ratchet up availability, it also runs the risk of depleting resources that are necessary to make sure people are fully vaccinated. The changes come after two Operation Warp Speed meetings held by HHS Secretary Alex Azar over the past 48 hours about how to speed up the lagging process, according to the official. Vaccine manufacturing has not ramped up as rapidly as many experts had hoped. Appearing on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Tuesday morning, Azar downplayed the significance of the shift, calling it \"just a staging, moving to the next phase on the vaccine program.\" Last week, two top officials from the FDA said anyone who receives the reserved vaccines needs both doses, dismissing the idea of stretching the supply by allowing just one dose or cutting doses in half. They also dismissed other ideas for stretching the vaccine supply and said people who are speculating about the possibility of making do with just one dose or cutting doses in half are misinterpreting the data.  \"We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA's vaccine division, said in a statement at the time. Nearly 9 million people have received their first doses of vaccine and nearly 25.5 million doses of vaccine have now been distributed, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. But that's far behind initial administration estimates, which at one point predicted 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by the end of 2020. Meanwhile, the coronavirus is surging across the United States. More than 200,000 new Covid-19 cases have been reported every single day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the US has averaged more than 3,200 reported deaths each day over that period.", "As of Tuesday evening, 4,197 deaths were reported, according to JHU. This is not the complete total for Tuesday, though, because final numbers come in overnight.  The only other time the number of deaths have gone over 4,000 took place on January 7 when 4,194 total deaths were reported, according to JHU data.  Prior to Tuesday's record-setting death toll, the US had averaged more than 3,223 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week, JHU data showed.  After widespread concerns about delays in vaccinations, the Trump administration will now release reserved second doses immediately, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. Such a plan had already been announced by President-elect Joe Biden. More than 9 million people have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and more than 27 million doses have been distributed, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means one-third of vaccines that have been delivered have been given to people. Six states -- North Dakota, West Virginia, Connecticut, South Dakota, Montana and Tennessee -- have administered enough first doses to account for more than half of the doses they've received.  Meanwhile, seven states -- Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama, Hawaii, Virginia, Idaho and California -- have administered less than a quarter of the doses they've received.  Officials with Operation Warp Speed defended the slow rollout of vaccines Tuesday, saying states were sticking too rigidly to guidance designating health care workers and nursing home residents to be vaccinated first. They said the rollout would speed up soon, and asked states to open up vaccination to everyone 65 and older and to younger people with chronic conditions. Over the past week, an average of 248,650 new Covid-19 infections have been reported every day. The massive surge of Covid-19 nationwide has been fueled by holiday travels and casual at-home gatherings that experts had warned against.  \"This is what we were afraid of -- people letting their guard down over Christmas and New Year's,\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said.  New strategies for vaccinations The federal government has been holding back about half the available doses from vaccine makers Moderna and Pfizer to make sure everyone who gets a first dose gets their second needed dose on time. The Pfizer vaccine doses should be spaced 21 days apart, and the Moderna doses should be 28 days apart.  But on Tuesday, Azar said, \"We do not need to hold back reserve doses\" anymore.  \"Every vaccine dose that is sitting in a warehouse without going into an arm could mean one more life lost or another hospital bed occupied,\" Azar said. If any glitches happen with vaccine production, any new doses would be designated as second doses.   In addition to releasing reserved doses immediately, HHS announced vaccines will be distributed to states based on which jurisdictions are getting the most doses into arms and where the most older adults live. That new strategy will begin in two weeks, Azar said Tuesday.   \"We will be allocating them based on the pace of administration as reported by states and by the size of the 65 and over population in each state. We're giving states two weeks' notice of this shift to give them the time necessary to plan and to improve their reporting if they think their data is faulty,\" Azar said. \"This new system gives states a strong incentive to ensure that all vaccinations are being properly reported, which it currently is not, and it gives states a strong incentive to ensure doses are going to work,\" he said.  \"We need doses going to where they'll be administered quickly and to where they'll protect the most vulnerable.\" Millions of doses are ready to go About 9 million people have now received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and more than 25.4 million doses have been distributed across the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Amid a rollout that has been far slower than some officials hoped, more states are abandoning guidelines from the CDC and taking their own approach to administering the vaccine, a new analysis found.  Timelines vary across the country and \"access to Covid-19 vaccines in these first months of the US vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives,\" the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care policy, said in a report issued Monday. The report found 40 states are still in Phase 1a -- when the CDC recommends vaccinating health care workers and long-term care facility residents -- either fully or partly. Ten states and Washington DC were in Phase 1b. Only Michigan has moved to at least part of Phase 1c, the report said. For Phase 1b, CDC recommends vaccinating people age 75 and older and frontline essential workers and for Phase 1c, the agency recommends the vaccinations of people 65 and older, younger people with high-risk conditions and other essential workers.  States are \"making the decision to just get as many people vaccinated as they can,\" and bypassing recommendations for vaccine prioritization, said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee on Monday.  \"I think where people are right now is they have the vaccine and they just want to get it out there,\" Offit said.  Without the \"public health infrastructure for mass vaccination\" in place, states are having to learn how to manage mass vaccinations in real time, and some are learning quicker than others, he added.  How states are bolstering vaccine efforts  In at least 10 states, National Guard members are helping administer vaccines. Other states have asked dentists, retirees and students to aid in the process.  In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott toured a mass Covid-19 vaccination site Monday and said the state plans to open about 28 similar sites across 18 counties.  \"These vaccination hubs will expedite vaccine distribution and ensure efficiency in communities across the state,\" the governor said.  In California, 1 million health care workers, nursing home residents and staff will receive the vaccine by week's end, the governor promised Monday, as part of an \"all hands on deck\" push to serve the more vulnerable residents.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, meanwhile, sent a letter to Azar requesting permission to buy up to 100,000 doses of vaccines for the state.  \"We remain ready to accelerate distribution to get doses into arms,\" the governor said.  The letter comes after Whitmer and other state leaders urged government officials to distribute the vaccine doses that are currently being held back by the Trump administration. CDC to require all air travelers to US to show negative coronavirus test  The CDC announced Tuesday an order requiring all airline passengers entering the United States to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test before boarding flights to the US. \"Testing does not eliminate all risk,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement. \"But when combined with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations.\" This order will go into effect on January 26, the CDC said. The rule is similar to one put in place last month for passengers from the United Kingdom to the US, which requires that passengers have a negative test within three days of boarding their flight. For the UK requirement that went through last month, airlines can be subject to criminal penalties if they fail to comply, and passengers can be subject to criminal penalties if they willfully give false or misleading information. "], "sport": ["Fast forward over a half a century and events at the US Capitol suggest America is still struggling to realize King's dream as outgoing Sen. Kelly Loeffler discovered to her cost. Loeffler is the co-owner of a women's basketball team in the WNBA, The Atlanta Dream, named with a nod to King Jr., the nation's most iconic and revered civil rights activist and his hometown.  But in one of 2020's surprise endings, Loeffler's own political dreams were sensationally scuppered by the players of her own sports team, a group of her employees who rose up against her to secure, as MLK would have put it, \"the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"  It's one of the most extraordinary stories of what has been a seismic election season; the triumph of a group of athletes who set out with the intention of doing the right thing, but who, in the end, might also have helped change the course of history.  Elizabeth Williams says she never considered herself to be political; the British-born American basketball player was one of the top picks in the 2015 draft and she's played for the Atlanta Dream since 2016. But for the 27-year-old Williams and her teammates, everything changed in the summer of 2020.  \"After the brutal killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,\" Williams told CNN. \"We saw a large shift in the fight for social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. We wanted to feel like our voices were going to be heard.\"  Professional athletes understand all too well the risks associated with making a stand. Colin Kaepernick was frozen out of the NFL after taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016, while in the following year, catcher Bruce Maxwell received numerous death threats for doing the same thing ahead of a Major League Baseball game. But few players, if any, have ever stood in direct opposition to the personal interests and ambitions of their employer.    READ: Megan Rapinoe condemns US Capitol rioters as 'White supremacy mob'   The WNBA is well known for its support of social justice causes. Collectively, the players chose to dedicate last season to the memory of Breonna Taylor -- a Black woman who was shot and killed by police in her Kentucky apartment -- and they established their own social justice council. \"We made sure to support the 'Say Her Name' movement. You know, have Black Lives Matter on the court,\" Williams said. But then what she describes as \"a unique situation\" almost stopped them in their tracks.    The co-owner of their team, Loeffler, \"openly denounced Black Lives Matter in a letter to our league's commissioner, essentially denouncing Black Lives Matter and the movement and saying that we need to keep politics out of sports.\"   Loeffler described BLM as a \"very divisive organization\" which promotes \"violence and destruction across the country.\" The players knew what Loeffler was doing. As one of Georgia's two Republican senators, she was campaigning ahead of the 2020 election and trying to head off the challenge of another Republican, Doug Collins. That meant tacking to the extreme right of the political spectrum, pledging loyalty to US President Donald Trump and throwing out red meat to the party's base.  CNN has reached out to Loeffler's team for comment but is yet to receive a response.    Following the decision not to charge any of the police officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death, NBA star LeBron James tweeted, \"The most DISRESPECTED person on earth is THE BLACK WOMAN!\"    Asked about her own experience of being a Black woman in America, Williams told CNN that \"in addition to sometimes feeling a bit of fear, we often feel unheard. And specifically, as female athletes, we often feel that even more. So, we always find ways to try to speak up for people who often aren't heard.\"  In response to the stance of their team owner, Williams said the players were frustrated, disappointed and confused. \"There were definitely a lot of emotions,\" she explained.   The league told CNN that the demographic composition of the WNBA is 80% persons of color, some of whom, Williams said, have \"lost family members to gun violence, have felt a lot of this in a very personal way.\"  Some were furious. Before the decision not to charge officers involved in Taylor's shooting was made, the players' union, the WNBPA, tweeted \"E-N-O-U-G-H! O-U-T!\" over Loeffler's opposition to the WNBA's support for the BLM message while Dream guard Renee Montgomery posted that she was \"pretty sad to see that my team ownership is not supportive of the movement & all that it stands for. I was already sitting out this season & this is an example of why.\" Montgomery was on a sabbatical to focus on social justice reform.    READ: 'If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never stepped foot in the NFL'  There were calls for Loeffler to stand down and a team statement on July 10, signed by all the players, read: \"We are the women of the Atlanta Dream. We are women who support a movement. We are strong and we are fearless. We offer a voice to the voiceless. Our team is united in the Movement for Black Lives. It is not extreme to demand change after centuries of inequality. This is not a political statement. This is a statement of humanity. Black Lives Matter.\"  Throughout the course of the interview with Williams, it became apparent that she hadn't once mentioned Loeffler by name. \"People in politics talked about the power of saying someone's name,\" she said. \"And so you can also do the opposite by not saying someone's name.\"  The name they chose to say instead was Reverend Raphael Warnock, a Democratic challenger to Loeffler who was a long shot in the senate race, polling in single digits among registered voters in July, according to Monmouth University Poll.  But at the start of August, without saying another word to criticize their owner Loeffler, Dream players began publicly supporting her political rival.    \"We wanted to react in a way that was still so classy and still promoted what we want to promote,\" said Williams. It was a plan of action that had the support of players across the league and soon many of them were wearing t-shirts bearing the simple message \"Vote Warnock.\"    Posing in the t-shirt that same day, Williams tweeted, \"We are WNBA players, but like the late, great John Lewis said, we are also ordinary people with extraordinary vision.\"   Suddenly, Warnock's campaign was receiving national attention, players were endorsing him in media interviews and donations were rolling in from well beyond the Georgia borders. Warnock's campaign reportedly said that within just two days of the players getting involved, $200,000 was pledged and the volume of individual donors soared.   The surge of support enabled him to invest in more campaign advertisements and helped increase his campaign's momentum.   Speaking about the players' support, Warnock told USA Today: \"I think it was helpful. It was one of the many turning points in the campaign. It gave people a chance to look a little closer and say, 'Who is this Warnock guy and what is he about?'\"   From meager polling numbers of 9% in July, Warnock had climbed to 21% in September, according to the Monmouth University Poll, and two months later, he finished first in the election with 32.9%.  READ: LeBron talks to his children about the double standard of the US Capitol riots    Because state rules dictated that the winner would have needed to clear 50%, Warnock then lined up in a head-to-head runoff against Loeffler, who finished second in the November race with 25.9% of the vote. On January 5, in a one-on-one election, Warnock became Georgia's first-ever Black US senator and also the first Black Democratic US senator from a southern state.   By this point, though, his victory was even more significant. A quirk of fate meant that the two runoff elections in Georgia could hand the Democrats control of the Senate for the first time in six years. Warnock's win, paired with Jon Ossoff's success in the other race, has made President-elect Joe Biden's task of governing considerably easier than it might otherwise have been. Just as Warnock's election was historically significant, so, too, was Ossoff's; he's the first Jewish person that Georgia has sent to the Senate.   As news of Warnock's triumph became clear, text group chats among Atlanta players and their counterparts across the league began lighting up. Williams says she found it hard to sleep. \"Wow, we really did this! We helped flip the Senate,\" she recalled. \"A lot of the messages were just being thankful for being a part of this group of really, really impactful and incredible women.    \"You feel all the emotions; the pride, the joy and then the optimism. A lot of what we've seen politically has been surrounded in division and hate, and I think in this moment in particular, it was a moment to be hopeful.\"  The joy was short-lived, though. Within hours of Warnock's victory being confirmed, an angry mob had stormed the Capitol in Washington DC. An insurrection inspired by President Trump, left five people dead -- including a Capitol policeman. A despicable \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt was seen in the Capitol and the divisive Confederate flag (a relic of the Civil War and a modern-day symbol of racism) was paraded there for the first time in the history of the United States.   Williams, who's now playing basketball in Turkey, says she was disappointed and frustrated, though not necessarily surprised, and felt helpless and embarrassed by the scenes playing out on TV.    \"Often in the history of America, we're in this juxtaposition of something really good happening and something bad. You know, like the fact that the [Georgia Senate runoff] election was the same day that we got the news that the officer that shot Jacob Blake wouldn't be charged.\"   Despite all the progress that has been made, Williams says that \"we do always have to be aware and have to be accountable for a grave history of White supremacy and fear.\"   Williams says the experience of the last year has changed her mindset forever. \"Yeah, I guess I'm a little more political now,\" she reflected. \"I think I always paid attention to these things, but I always felt like, 'Well, you know, somebody else will do it.' But I've grown into stepping out and trying to be a leader in these moments.\"   As MLK himself said: \"A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right.

He didn't invent the game in Ontario, that would come when he was a physical education teacher at what is now Springfield College in Massachusetts. There is believed to be the only one audio recording of Naismith, which was discovered by University of Kansas professor. The interview took place in New York on January 31, 1939, just months before Naismith died that November, aged 78. Naismith was in New York to attend a basketball doubleheader at Madison Square Garden, 48 years after he created the very game that he was watching. Naismith said it all began in the winter of 1891, when he was a physical education teacher.  \"We had a real New England blizzard,\" Naismith said. \"For days, the students couldn't go outdoors, so they began roughhousing in the halls. We tried everything to keep them quiet. We tried playing a modified form of football in the gymnasium, but they got bored with that. Something had to be done.\" Then one day, Naismith got an idea. At each end of the gym, Naismith nailed up two peach baskets. He called the students to the gym and split them into teams of nine and gave them an old soccer ball and told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket. \"I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began,\" Naismith said. However, there was a major problem. Naismith didn't have enough rules for his new game, and he said that's where he made his big mistake. \"The boys began tackling, kicking and punching in the clinches,\" Naismith said. \"They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. Before I could pull them apart, one boy was knocked out, several of them had black eyes, and one had a dislocated shoulder. It certainly was murder.\" But the students nagged at Naismith to let them play again. So he made up some more rules, which included one that he deemed the most important: no running with the ball. \"That stopped tackling and slugging,\" Naismith said. \"We tried out the game with those rules, and we didn't have one casualty. We had a fine, clean sport.\" READ: LeBron hits no-look three pointer to win mid-game bet Ten years later, Naismith said, basketball was being played all over the country. The sport had its Summer Olympics debut in the 1936 Games in Berlin. The radio interview was aired on a program named \"We the People,\" hosted by Gabriel Heatter, on WOR-AM. The audio was discovered by Michael Zogry, who is an associate professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Kansas, while researching his book in progress called \"Religion and Basketball: Naismith's Game.\" Naismith went on to earn his medical degree and was hired by Kansas in 1898. He was KU's first athletic director and was the school's first basketball coach (1899-1907).

Ridley has form when it comes to asking people to perform simple tasks for the environment. In Sydney in 2007, he started Earth Hour -- the global \"lights out\" movement which asked whole cities to turn off non-essential lights for an hour on a designated day -- that has since spread to 188 countries.   Now, he and local scientists are asking people to take photos for the \"Great Reef Census,\" the biggest ever communal effort to map the world's largest reef system, that stretches 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) down the Queensland coast.  \"It is about reminding the world that this inspirational place is here and we need to do everything we can to keep it in the best shape possible,\" said Ridley, CEO of the non-profit Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef. The Citizens team has been testing the logistics of the census, and hope to finalize details in the next few months. \"It's got a lot of momentum,\" Ridley said. \"But it's still a crazy idea -- you know that, right?\"  Crisis meeting The idea for the census came in 2017. Ten severe tropical cyclones in 12 years had smashed parts of the reef, while the ravages of climate change -- rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification -- had left once vibrant coral communities bleached and fragile. At a conference in the northern city of Townsville, delegates were told the reef was in \"crisis.\"  They agreed \"dramatic\" change was needed in the way the Great Barrier Reef was managed if it was to survive. Ridley chatted with Peter Mumby, head of the Marine Spatial Ecology Lab at the University of Queensland, and Roger Beeden, the director of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. They needed to know more about the state of the reef, but were coming up short.  Long-term scientific monitoring had only collected detailed information on a small number of reefs -- not enough for marine park managers to form a cohesive response to climate change. \"If you want to understand where there are opportunities to respond after bleaching events, or to actually look after key areas, then we need to have information from a much greater number of reefs,\" Beeden said. \"To try to get that information ... you need to mobilize a huge workforce,\" Mumby said. \"(Scientists) don't have the resources and time to do that kind of survey.\" Ridley was looking for a project, Beeden and Mumby needed people, and so began discussions for the Great Reef Census.  How it will work  For several weeks late next year, anyone -- locals, tourists, fishermen, superyacht and other boat owners -- will be asked to take photos of the reef and upload them to an app. Then, anyone in the world with internet access will be invited to log on to help identify what's there.  You don't need to be a coral expert to become involved. Scientists say some of the most recognizable coral species are also the most important for reef restoration. \"That includes reefs that are dominated by these big plate-like corals, which are really important in stimulating recovery,\" Mumby said. \"Also, reefs that have what we're describing as monumental corals -- coral monuments -- which are exceptionally old, long-lived corals that have survived being damaged for one reason or another.\"  \"They're like the long, slow, old growth forests that we see in rainforests, the enormous trees,\" Beeden explained.  If scientists can identify the location of corals that naturally work to regenerate the reef, they can help protect them to give the reef the best chance it has to survive the climate crisis. \"As a reef manager, there's not much you can do to stop things warming up. (But) not everywhere warms up at the same rate. If you can map where that variation exists, and find those areas that are really important for recovery ... then you're strategically managing that recovery process as best you can,\" Mumby said. 'The reef is not dead' Ridley's Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef has been trying to get as many ambassadors onto the water as possible. Along with David de Rothschild, they've hosted model Jarrod Scott and the Australian Dolphins Swim Team.   Mumby bristles at the suggestion that the census is some kind of a publicity stunt. \"There's a very genuine scientific need for this information,\" Mumby said. \"We unashamedly want to have a different conversation about the reef globally, because at the moment the prevailing global conversation seems to be the reef is dead.\" News reports about the reef's demise spread worldwide in 2016 after Outside Magazine published a satirical obituary, horrifying scientists and creating a false perception that they've spent years trying to fix. \"It's deeply frustrating on a couple of fronts,\" Ridley said. \"When you get people believing that we've lost one of the world's greatest natural icons it doesn't inspire action, it actually inspires more apathy.\" Space the size of Italy  Maps of the reef are already being created using satellite images that can see to a depth of 20 meters in clear water. But they only provide a rough outline of the reef.  Details -- like the types of coral that are growing in a particular area -- are added later, when scientists refer to notes from field trips, or take an educated guess based on environmental conditions. \"From satellite imagery you can derive water depth. Water depth and wind creates waves and waves influence where coral types like to grow,\" explained Chris Roelfsema, co-director of the Remote Sensing Research Centre at the University of Queensland. This year, Roelfsema's team produced the first ever geomorphic map that shows the entire Great Barrier Reef system -- all 3,000 individual coral reefs. Photos from the reef census will be useful, he said, to help validate the geomorphic maps, and to fill the gaps where no data currently exists. Scientists are under no illusions about the size of the task ahead. \"The reason why this hasn't happened before is because it's a very large thing to do,\" said Beeden. \"A space the size of Italy with 3,000 reefs, many of which are actually very remote, presents some very substantial logistical challenges.\" Funding is required if the project is going to fulfill its potential to reach parts of the reef that have never been explored before. Ridley is talking with potential sponsors and hopes to announce a deal in January. He's confident the logistical challenges will be overcome and, by this time next year, scientists will have a much better idea of the state of the reef -- and most importantly, how to save it.  \"If we give up on something as amazing as the Great Barrier Reef,\" he says, \"and we think it's gone, and we're OK with that, what are we not OK with losing?\"", "", "No really, it can happen. Take Zuraina Zaharin from Malaysia. She's built a business off the back of a loo break. Not just any loo break, of course. This one was near Everest in the early 2000s when she was climbing in the region -- and it was pretty bleak. \"I was facing this problem: the toilet,\" she explains. \"It's easy for men to do their business; they can just do it anywhere. But not for the ladies. We have to wait until we find some nice spot. Even then, I can't do it. I just have to find the toilet.\" Things didn't improve upon discovering the facilities, however. \"The last toilet at Everest base camp is a pit latrine,\" Zaharin continues. \"The smell, God knows... it's so stinky.\" Zaharin had traveled to the Himalayas, only to encounter \"a mountain of poop.\" The problem hasn't exactly gone away. In 2018, 28,000 pounds of human waste was hauled from Everest base camp during the climbing season, according to a local NGO tasked with cleaning up Everest, and dumped in open pits where it risks entering the water supply system. It was an extreme example of unsafely managed sanitation -- something 4.5 billion people have to live with, according to the World Health Organization. Even flush toilets can bring their own problems, according to the UN, potentially \"increasing water stresses\" in countries with an inadequate water supply. Zaharin, an entrepreneur, adventurer and environmentalist, did not forget her Everest experience. When she attended a business forum in 2012 and listened to a man looking for investment in a sustainable toilet, ideal for locations with poor sanitation or little water, the stars aligned. Imad Agi from Sweden conceived a waterless toilet system that turns human waste into fertilizer without the harmful germs that can cause sickness if used in agriculture -- ideal for organic farming. Agi and Zaharin went into business together as co-founders of EcoLoo, refining the toilet and taking it to market. The toilet works by adding a microbe solution to the waste chamber. The microbes break down human solids -- normally in three to four days -- leaving behind \"ashes,\" while liquid waste is turned into liquid fertilizer, which can be extracted via an outlet, Zaharin explains. EcoLoo recommends the microbe solution is topped up once a month and costs $60 for a year's supply. EcoLoo claims it's less energy-intensive than a regular toilet because there's no waste water to separate and process. And before you ask, no, it doesn't smell, says Zaharin -- the bacterial process prevents bad odors from building in the tank. The toilet range, priced between $800-$2,500, has gone on to win a clutch of awards and sell over 2,000 units in 21 countries. Notable examples include units installed at Petra, the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Jordan. Zaharin says the EcoLoo could potentially play a role in disaster relief efforts when sanitation issues, often related to contaminated water supplies, cause diseases to spread rapidly. Of course, it's not the only waterless toilet on the block. Models have been around for decades in the developed world in one shape or form, incinerating, freezing or composting waste. But EcoLoo believes its low-energy product could have wide appeal. We're using 141 billion liters of fresh water globally every day to flush toilets -- six times the daily water consumption of the population of Africa -- per one recent study. Meanwhile, \"water stress is the biggest crisis no on is talking about,\" Andrew Steer, the head of the World Resources Institute, said earlier this year.  Diarrhea linked to inadequate sanitation causes an estimated 432,000 deaths every year, says the UN. The current climate seems ripe for less resource and energy-intensive toilets to become mainstream. Zaharin says her company has long since grown beyond its original purpose to serve rural communities. Luxury models and smaller units designed for transport and island holiday resorts are also on the market, she says. The EcoLoo co-founder still has one mountain to conquer: getting her toilet installed at Everest base camp. A plan to have one fitted was scuppered by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. But the dream lives on. \"Being an adventurer, I would never give up,\" she says. "], "entertainment": ["Finding respite in popular culture from the stress of recent events, however, won't be easy. Politics and political figures are intersecting with pop culture, whether we want them to or not.  Kamala Harris: The vice president-elect is on the cover of the new issue of Vogue magazine, and some people aren't happy with the cover image. That's because the selected photo showed Harris wearing a casual black jacket, white top and Converse sneakers, posing in front of a pink and green background (the colors of her sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha). Some deemed the choice \"disrespectful\" and not befitting the first American woman to serve as vice president, let alone the first woman of color.  Vogue is, of course, the fashion bible so the controversy was the topic of much debate on social media. Arnold Schwarzenegger: The \"Terminator\" star and former governor of California took Donald Trump to task following the deadly storming of the Capitol in Washington, DC, by a group of the President's supporters. Schwarzenegger posted a video on social media in which he said \"President Trump is a failed leader. He will go down in history as the worst President ever. The good thing is he will soon be as irrelevant as an old tweet.\" And lest we forget Schwarzenegger is a movie star, he used as a prop a sword he said belonged to Conan the Barbarian, the character he played in the 1982 film of the same name. \"Our democracy is like the steel of this sword,\" he said. \"The more it is tempered, the stronger it becomes.\" Brian Littrell: A few Backstreet Boys fans had some harsh words for Littrell. That's because the singer tweeted an invite for his followers to come to Parler, the social media platform favored by the far-right. \"BTLittrell come find me... hahah like where's Waldo, he tweeted. \"Join me on Parler Social Media!\" His mentions sparked plenty of anger and disappointment, with some expressing that they were done supporting the singer, while others argued Littrell had a right to his political opinions.  Those wanting to join him didn't have long to act on his suggestion. Parler went offline after Google, Apple and Amazon dropped it amid complaints the company hadn't done enough to stem the violent rhetoric surrounding the Capitol riots.  Parler has since sued Amazon, which hosted it online.  I have gone on record with my stance that celebs have an absolute right to be politically active, as do all citizens, as long as they do so peacefully.  But in the painful days we have already endured, with sadly more probably to come, it would be nice if pop culture could offer more of a distraction that many of us need right now.

Based on an actual night in 1964 in which Cassius Clay (soon to be Muhammad Ali), Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown gathered to celebrate Clay's heavyweight title win, it is adapted from a Kemp Powers stage play. \"One Night in Miami\" starts streaming Friday on Amazon Prime.  'WandaVision' What could be better than a blend of classic television and the Marvel Cinematic Universe? In this series, Wanda Maximoff (played by Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) are two beings living idealized suburban lives while concealing their superpowers. That changes when they begin to suspect that everything is not quite as it seems.  \"WandaVision\" debuts on Disney+ Friday. 'Bling Empire' Is there such a thing as too many Kardashian-type reality shows? (You probably already know the answer to that.) Netflix has a new series that \"follows a wildly wealthy group of Asian and Asian American friends (and frenemies) in Los Angeles.\" The show promises plenty of glitz and drama. \"Bling Empire\" starts streaming Friday.   Two things to listen to: The boy band Why Don't We disappeared from the scene for a minute and sparked #WhereIsWDW on Twitter.

If you love, love, love the British royal family as much as I do, let me hip you to this podcast. \"Royally Obsessed\" features co-hosts Roberta Fiorito and Rachel Bowie discussing all news related to the House of Windsor.  There is plenty of discussion about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and baby Archie, natch, so I'm here for it.  One thing to talk about: How well will \"Sex and the City\" age?  That is the question now that HBO Max has announced it's rebooting the popular series, 17 years later after it went off the air.  Only three of the original stars are returning: Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. Their costar Kim Cattrall said long ago she would not be interested in returning for more. Much has changed since the HBO series (and its big-screen adaptations) were out. Where have the lives of characters of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker), Miranda Hobbes (Nixon) and Charlotte York Goldenblatt (Davis) led them to this point? New York City always felt like one of the cast members -- and the Big Apple is definitely not the same. So, what does it all mean for the next chapter of \"Sex and the City\"?  We'll be dealing with Carrie fever while we wait and see. (HBO Max is owned by CNN's parent company.)  Something to sip on Happy 99th birthday, Betty White! The beloved actress celebrates her big day on Sunday -- and aren't we all the better for it? There are few in Hollywood who have achieved the level of admiration that White has over the course of her accomplished career. She truly is our \"Golden Girl.\"  ", "The first three episodes of the nine-part series prove stingy with significant clues, so the audience should be forewarned to buckle in for the ride. The satirical framework -- placing the central duo in old sitcoms -- will also resonate more with an audience able to appreciate how meticulously director Matt Shakman and head writer Jac Schaeffer have replicated them, unless the kids were weaned on programs like \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and \"Bewitched\" and will get visual gags about married couples in separate beds. The most familiar elements, happily, see the return of Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany as Wanda and the Vision, the Scarlet Witch and synthetic android whose unlikely love affair migrated from the pages of the Avengers comics to the screen. They're reintroduced, somewhat jarringly, in a black-and-white sitcom episode, reflecting a real fondness for the genre, and portrayed with spot-on performances by the leads. The show features plenty of knowing nods to early-TV conventions -- including canned laughter, Kathryn Hahn as the nosy neighbor, and theme songs courtesy of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the couple that lodged all those \"Frozen\" tunes in parents' heads. What's really going on here, given where movie-goers saw these Avengers last? That's the fundamental mystery, one the producing team is clearly in no hurry to divulge. Patience becomes a virtue, taking in the sitcom homages while maintaining a watchful eye for sly Marvel references and cleverly placed dollops of color, presenting possible cracks in the black-and-white veneer. The usual special-effects pyrotechnics, meanwhile, are channeled into much more subtle triumphs of production design and costuming -- a TV show that turns decades of TV history into an ally. Overall, \"WandaVision\" serves as a shrewd and generally impressive calling card for Marvel's broader Disney+ strategy, after the high bar that Lucasfilm established with \"The Mandalorian.\" Unlike the smaller-scale shows produced for ABC and Netflix, these projects draw upon high-profile names from the movies -- with the still-to-come \"Loki\" and \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" -- then showcase them in ways that emphasize character over cinematic blockbuster trappings. Of course, something structured like \"WandaVision\" can only truly be judged once you've reached the end of the journey. For starters, though, the studio's streaming vision looks quite clear, even if these heroes' black-and-white fate doesn't. \"WandaVision\" premieres Jan. 15 on Disney+.
