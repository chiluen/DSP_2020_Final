{"business": ["Another 965,000 people filed for first-time unemployment benefits on a seasonally adjusted basis in the United States last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That was substantially higher than the previous week, when 784,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits, and far worse than economists had expected. Weekly first-time jobless claims are stuck at an uncomfortably high level. In late August, the figure dropped below 1 million, but since then, significant improvements have been hard to come by -- and last week represented a huge step in the wrong direction. Without seasonal adjustments, initial claims are back up above a million, which is a terrifyingly high number and more than three times more than in the same period last year. On top of regular claims, 284,470 workers filed claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, about 100,000 more than in the prior week. The program provides aid to people like the self-employed or gig workers, who aren't covered under regular benefits. After the new stimulus deal extended the program, it is now slated to end in March. Added together, initial benefit claims totaled 1.4 million last week, excluding seasonal adjustments, the highest total since mid-September. The passage of the second pandemic stimulus bill at the end of December likely added to the jump in benefit applications, said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in a note to clients. Continued claims, which count workers who have claimed aid for at least two weeks in a row, stood at 5.3 million in the week ended January 2, more than economists had predicted. With the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden less than a week away, Thursday's report again hammers home that the new administration's first priority has got to be more stimulus. The government's jobs report released last week showed 140,000 American jobs were lost in December -- the first loss since April, when the economy was in freefall.  \"The fact that benefits claims are increasing suggests that the economy may lose jobs again in January, as the number of coronavirus cases continues to surge, weighing heavily on businesses,\" said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, in emailed comments. Biden plans to create millions of jobs, including in the infrastructure and clean energy industries. Experts hope that Democratic control across the White House and Congress means a more stimulus quickly. But the turmoil on Capitol Hill, including the second impeachment of President Donald Trump by the House of Representatives, could derail bipartisan cooperation.", "As a result of the far-reaching and rapid spread of Covid-19, state and local governments' pandemic-mitigation policies are becoming more restrictive and consumers are again limiting their consumption of in-person services. The Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Stringency Index, which accounts for measures like school and workplace closures and travel bans, increased for the United States during the first half of November and has remained at elevated levels since then. The added restrictions limited the ability of households to go out and spend.  Consumption, which makes up about two-thirds of the economy, was already down 0.4% in November, after six straight months of increases: Spending on restaurants and bars was down 4%, for example. The winter decline could be even worse. The economic weakness is filtering into the labor market. The number of initial claims for unemployment has been trending upward. And in December, for the first time since April, the number of jobs in the US economy declined. Shrinking employment may continue over the rest of the winter, especially for the industries that suffered the most from the pandemic thus far, like restaurants, travel, accommodation, out-of-home entertainment and personal services.  But while the outlook for the winter is bleak, the US labor market should get much stronger in the second half of 2021, mostly because of the impact of the vaccination campaign. According to some estimates, by August or September, the United States could reach herd immunity, preceded by very low rates of new infections in late spring. Herd immunity means that a large enough percentage of a population, 70% to 90%, has become immune to Covid-19, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for people who lack immunity. This would allow local governments' social distancing policies to become less stringent and the economy to recover as consumers feel more comfortable engaging in in-person services.  And many US consumers will be ready and able to spend. Since March, households' average saving rates have been historically high, and their housing and stocks portfolios have been rapidly growing. Overall, many will likely emerge from the pandemic with stronger personal finances than they had before. It should be noted that within this aggregate positive financial outlook, many households have been financially ruined by business closures and layoffs caused by the pandemic.  As a result, in the second half of 2021, a strong US economic recovery is likely to take place. Economic activity is likely to be about 5% above the first half of the year, according to The Conference Board. The recovery will be especially strong in the hardest-hit industries, where employment levels are still very depressed compared with pre-pandemic levels.  We cannot expect a full employment recovery in early 2022, because automation and corporate reorganizations permanently eliminated many jobs. But barring a major slowdown in the vaccination campaign, I project that 3.5 to 5 million new jobs should be created in the United States by the first quarter of 2022.  When the unemployment rate almost reached 15% in April 2020, few expected it to return to its natural rate of about 4.2% to 4.5% in the foreseeable future. But the unemployment rate should dip below 5% in the first quarter of 2022 and perhaps even reach 4.5% by year's end.  This is partly due to the strong employment growth, but also due to very weak growth in the labor force, driven by the massive number of Baby Boomers reaching retirement age. For the first time in US history, the population of working-age people (those between the ages of 16 and 64) is declining. This trend is likely to continue in the coming years. The unemployment rate will also be held down by the disappointing trend of declining labor force participation of other populations, especially men without a college degree.  Growing demand for and a stagnant supply of workers will lead to a tight labor market within two to three years, and in some blue-collar occupations, maybe even sooner. So as dark as these days are, hold on -- a much better labor market is around the corner.", "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. \"Everyone's trying to balance what this means in the short term,\" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told me. \"People aren't sure what to make of it.\" What's happening: Uncertainty about what comes next has forced investors to press pause. Stocks have been in a holding pattern for the past few trading sessions, and Thursday's futures are muted.  One fear is that the looming impeachment trial in the Senate will derail President-elect Joe Biden's economic agenda. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said it won't begin until after Biden is sworn in next week. The delay is bad news for Wall Street, which had been banking on the swift passage of another sizable stimulus package now that Democrats have control of both chambers of Congress. With the US economy under renewed pressure as coronavirus infections and deaths rise, stimulus checks, funding for state and local governments and enhancements to unemployment benefits are increasingly important. Biden, who is due to outline his economic rescue package on Thursday, has expressed concerns about Congress' ability to multitask. \"This nation ... remains in the grip of a deadly virus and a reeling economy,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.\" But exactly how lawmakers will manage this difficult juggling act remains to be seen. Big picture: Wall Street is eager to look past what some view as \"political noise\" and let the market rally resume. Optimism that vaccine efforts will lead to a recovery in corporate earnings in the second half of the year remains strong, as does faith that central banks like the Federal Reserve will keep providing necessary support. \"The stock market only cares about the direction of the economy, earnings, interest rates and the actions of the Fed,\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in an email. Should the fate of stimulus \u2014 and therefore the economy \u2014 be tied to impeachment proceedings, however, investors may have no choice but to let the politics play out. Investors cheer as Intel ousts CEO Wall Street is cheering after Intel (INTC) said it had replaced CEO Bob Swan after a rocky two-year run. The latest: The company said Wednesday that Pat Gelsinger, who has led software firm VMWare for roughly a decade, would take the reins on Feb. 15.  The announcement sent shares up 7%. They're rising another 2% in premarket trading Thursday. Investor insight: Intel's stock fell nearly 17% in 2020 while other tech firms rallied, as it lagged behind competitors in producing the most advanced microprocessors and struggled with manufacturing delays. In the meantime, AMD (AMD) stole market share in the key PC and data center markets, while Nvidia (NVDA) invested heavily in AI, my CNN Business colleagues Clare Duffy and Jordan Valinsky report. Intel's PC business also recently took a blow when Apple announced it will use its own processors, rather than Intel's, in its new series of Macs. AMD's stock doubled last year, while Nvidia \u2014 which is looking to buy chipmaker Arm for $40 billion \u2014 saw shares climb more than 120%. These dynamics stirred up a rebellion from activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point, who called on the company's chairman to hire an investment adviser to explore \"strategic alternatives\" aimed at regaining ground. Prior to his role at VMWare, Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, becoming became the company's first-ever chief technology officer. Analysts hope that given his technical background, he'll be able to make some important changes \u2014 and get Intel back on track. Dollar General will pay workers to get a Covid-19 vaccine Dollar General (DG) is determined that its employees get coronavirus vaccines \u2014 so much so that it's offering to cover the cost. The pitch: The chain said Wednesday that it will give its workers a one-time payment \u2014 equivalent to four hours of pay \u2014 after receiving a completed vaccination, my CNN Business colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn reports. \"We do not want our employees to have to choose between receiving a vaccine or coming to work,\" Dollar General said in a press release, noting that its hourly workers face hurdles to getting vaccinated, such as travel time, gas mileage or childcare needs. That said: The company, which had 157,000 employees as of Oct. 30, called getting a vaccine a \"personal decision\" and said it wouldn't require it. Such incentives could become increasingly popular among employers that are hesitant to issue outright vaccine mandates but want to protect workers. But a slower-than-expected rollout of vaccines across the United States may mean that even with employer support, some frontline workers can't access shots.  Most states are still only vaccinating health care workers and residents and staff in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, according to Kaiser. Essential workers, including retail and grocery store workers, are set to be vaccinated at a later stage, though their eligibility varies by states.

China's overall surplus for the year hit a record $535 billion, up 27% from 2019. Exports, meanwhile, rose to an all-time high. \"Amid all the noises on de-coupling and de-globalization, somewhat unexpectedly, the pandemic has deepened the ties between China and the rest of the world,\" wrote Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Capital, in a research report. Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, attributed China's gains largely to the country's management of the pandemic, which broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan just over a year ago. He added that China has benefited from a lot of demand for protective gear and electronics as people around the world worked from home.  \"After having recovered from its own Covid-19 crisis, China was open for business when the pandemic triggered huge demand in the US (and other countries) for Covid-19 related goods,\" Kuijs said.  China's trade relationship with the United States, meanwhile, became even more imbalanced: Beijing's trade surplus with Washington rose to $317 billion in 2020, a 7% increase from the year prior and the second highest amount on record, according to Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING. The amount is just $7 billion shy of 2018 levels, when Trump launched a blistering trade war to right what he called a lopsided relationship with the world's second largest economy.  \"Judged by the surge of US imports from China in 2020, it seems fair to say that Trump's trade war with the country failed,\" Kuijs said. The good trade news comes days before China is expected to announce GDP figures for the end of 2020 \u2014 another likely positive showing. Analysts widely expect that China's economic growth will pick up even more during the last three months of the year. Analysts polled by Reuters expect Chinese GDP to increase 2.1% for all of 2020. \"As [China] plays a critical role in many supply chains and remains a fundamentally very competitive place to produce, it is much easier said than done to 'decouple' from it,\" Kuijs said. China's future isn't without its challenges, though. Analysts point out that President-elect Joe Biden likely won't reverse some of the pressure on the country after he takes office next week. \"The Biden government will take a different, less combative and more steady approach to China,\" Kuijs said. \"But it is politically not possible for Biden to remove the tariffs on Chinese goods any time soon.\"", "State-run news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday that Chinese President Xi Jinping had written to Schultz, encouraging the American billionaire and the global coffee giant he ran for years to improve economic and trade ties. Xi's letter was in response to a message from the US businessman. According to a person familiar with the matter, Schultz recently sent the Chinese president a translated copy of his latest book, \"From the Ground Up: A Journey to Reimagine the Promise of America.\" The correspondence included a letter to Xi, which pointed to Starbucks' longstanding commitment to China and its employees there, the person added.  According to Xinhua, Xi suggested that Schultz and Starbucks (SBUX) \"continue to play a positive role in advancing\" relations between the two countries. Xi also emphasized that China was working to open up further to \"enterprises from across the world, including Starbucks and other American companies,\" the agency reported. In a statement, Schultz said it was a \"great honor\" to have received a reply from Xi. \"I truly believe Starbucks' best days are ahead in China and that the values of creativity, compassion, community and hard work will guide the company toward an even greater business and community contribution, while continuing to build common ground for cooperation between our two countries,\" he added. Schultz stepped down as chairman of Starbucks in 2018, after which he took on the honorary title of chairman emeritus. At the time, he said that he was exploring a run for president as an independent candidate in 2020. Those plans were eventually called off. Schultz is outspoken on political issues. During his four decades at Starbucks, he positioned the company as a progressive champion in corporate America. Schultz has also addressed US-China ties. In 2018, he lamented the effects of the trade war, saying that US tariffs on Chinese goods wouldn't help American jobs. China is Starbucks' top overseas growth market. \"Every time that we have had a conflict of trade, and there have been trade wars, it has resulted in a downturn of the economy of the United States,\" he told CNN at the time. \"This is what I really believe. The country [of] America should not be building walls of any kind. We should be building bridges.\""], "health": ["Air passengers will be required to get a viral test within three days before their flight to the United States departs, and to provide written documentation of their lab results, or documentation of having recovered from Covid-19, the agency said in a statement to CNN.  CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield is expected to sign the order on Tuesday and it will go into effect on January 26.  \"Variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus continue to emerge in countries around the world, and there is evidence of increased transmissibility of some of these variants,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"With the US already in surge status, the testing requirement for air passengers will help slow the spread of the virus as we work to vaccinate the American public.\" If a passenger does not provide documentation of a negative test or recovery, or chooses not to take a test, the airline must not allow the passenger to board, the CDC said.  \"Testing does not eliminate all risk, but when combined with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations,\" Redfield said in the statement. The new variant of coronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible, has already been found in at least 10 states in samples dating back to mid-December. An airline industry group has expressed support for the new measure.  \"[We are] writing to express our support for a [CDC] proposal to control the spread of COVID-19, including variants of the virus, by implementing a global program to require testing for travelers to the United States,\" the industry group Airlines for America wrote to Vice President Mike Pence on January 4.  The new rule is similar to one put in place last month for passengers from the UK to the US, which requires that passengers have a negative test within three days of boarding their flight. For the UK requirement that went through last month, airlines can be subject to criminal penalties if they fail to comply, and passengers can be subject to criminal penalties if they willfully give false or misleading information.    The earlier requirement for UK travelers was a response to a new coronavirus variant that was identified in the UK. While the variant appears to spread more easily, there's no evidence that it's any more deadly or causes more severe disease, according to CDC.  At least 72 cases of a variant first identified in the UK have been found in 10 US states, according to data posted Monday by the CDC. That includes at least 32 cases in California, 22 cases in Florida, five cases in Minnesota, four cases in New York, three cases in Colorado, two cases in Connecticut, and one case each in Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Georgia. The variant has been identified in dozens of countries worldwide.", "The Trump administration plans to release reserved second doses immediately, a senior administration official tells CNN. The official expects reserved doses to be distributed over the next two weeks.  The move comes after Trump administration officials recently disparaged Biden's plan to do the same. \"If President-elect Biden is calling for the distribution of vaccines knowing that there would not be a second dose available, that decision is without science or data and is contrary to the FDA's approved label,\" Operation Warp Speed spokesman Michael Pratt said Friday in light of Biden's announcement. \"If President-elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening.\" The new plan would also change guidelines to allow vaccinations immediately for anyone anyone 65 and older and would help states set up mass vaccination sites should they request assistance. The administration wants to shift focus away from hospitals and focus more on adding more accessible venues, such as pharmacies, the source said. This will attempt to address a reoccurring issue states have faced in trying to administer the vaccine through hospitals and medical providers that have said they don't have the resources or personnel to serve as vaccination clinics. The Trump administration which had previously balked at releasing all available doses.  Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines require two rounds of injection, and while releasing nearly all vaccine doses on hand could quickly ratchet up availability, it also runs the risk of depleting resources that are necessary to make sure people are fully vaccinated. The changes come after two Operation Warp Speed meetings held by HHS Secretary Alex Azar over the past 48 hours about how to speed up the lagging process, according to the official. Vaccine manufacturing has not ramped up as rapidly as many experts had hoped. Appearing on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Tuesday morning, Azar downplayed the significance of the shift, calling it \"just a staging, moving to the next phase on the vaccine program.\" Last week, two top officials from the FDA said anyone who receives the reserved vaccines needs both doses, dismissing the idea of stretching the supply by allowing just one dose or cutting doses in half. They also dismissed other ideas for stretching the vaccine supply and said people who are speculating about the possibility of making do with just one dose or cutting doses in half are misinterpreting the data.  \"We have been following the discussions and news reports about reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, changing the dose (half-dose), or mixing and matching vaccines in order to immunize more people against COVID-19,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, who heads FDA's vaccine division, said in a statement at the time. Nearly 9 million people have received their first doses of vaccine and nearly 25.5 million doses of vaccine have now been distributed, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. But that's far behind initial administration estimates, which at one point predicted 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by the end of 2020. Meanwhile, the coronavirus is surging across the United States. More than 200,000 new Covid-19 cases have been reported every single day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the US has averaged more than 3,200 reported deaths each day over that period.", "As of Tuesday evening, 4,197 deaths were reported, according to JHU. This is not the complete total for Tuesday, though, because final numbers come in overnight.  The only other time the number of deaths have gone over 4,000 took place on January 7 when 4,194 total deaths were reported, according to JHU data.  Prior to Tuesday's record-setting death toll, the US had averaged more than 3,223 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week, JHU data showed.  After widespread concerns about delays in vaccinations, the Trump administration will now release reserved second doses immediately, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. Such a plan had already been announced by President-elect Joe Biden. More than 9 million people have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and more than 27 million doses have been distributed, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means one-third of vaccines that have been delivered have been given to people. Six states -- North Dakota, West Virginia, Connecticut, South Dakota, Montana and Tennessee -- have administered enough first doses to account for more than half of the doses they've received.  Meanwhile, seven states -- Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama, Hawaii, Virginia, Idaho and California -- have administered less than a quarter of the doses they've received.  Officials with Operation Warp Speed defended the slow rollout of vaccines Tuesday, saying states were sticking too rigidly to guidance designating health care workers and nursing home residents to be vaccinated first. They said the rollout would speed up soon, and asked states to open up vaccination to everyone 65 and older and to younger people with chronic conditions. Over the past week, an average of 248,650 new Covid-19 infections have been reported every day. The massive surge of Covid-19 nationwide has been fueled by holiday travels and casual at-home gatherings that experts had warned against.  \"This is what we were afraid of -- people letting their guard down over Christmas and New Year's,\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said.  New strategies for vaccinations The federal government has been holding back about half the available doses from vaccine makers Moderna and Pfizer to make sure everyone who gets a first dose gets their second needed dose on time. The Pfizer vaccine doses should be spaced 21 days apart, and the Moderna doses should be 28 days apart.  But on Tuesday, Azar said, \"We do not need to hold back reserve doses\" anymore.  \"Every vaccine dose that is sitting in a warehouse without going into an arm could mean one more life lost or another hospital bed occupied,\" Azar said. If any glitches happen with vaccine production, any new doses would be designated as second doses.   In addition to releasing reserved doses immediately, HHS announced vaccines will be distributed to states based on which jurisdictions are getting the most doses into arms and where the most older adults live. That new strategy will begin in two weeks, Azar said Tuesday.   \"We will be allocating them based on the pace of administration as reported by states and by the size of the 65 and over population in each state. We're giving states two weeks' notice of this shift to give them the time necessary to plan and to improve their reporting if they think their data is faulty,\" Azar said. \"This new system gives states a strong incentive to ensure that all vaccinations are being properly reported, which it currently is not, and it gives states a strong incentive to ensure doses are going to work,\" he said.  \"We need doses going to where they'll be administered quickly and to where they'll protect the most vulnerable.\" Millions of doses are ready to go About 9 million people have now received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and more than 25.4 million doses have been distributed across the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Amid a rollout that has been far slower than some officials hoped, more states are abandoning guidelines from the CDC and taking their own approach to administering the vaccine, a new analysis found.  Timelines vary across the country and \"access to Covid-19 vaccines in these first months of the US vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives,\" the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care policy, said in a report issued Monday. The report found 40 states are still in Phase 1a -- when the CDC recommends vaccinating health care workers and long-term care facility residents -- either fully or partly. Ten states and Washington DC were in Phase 1b. Only Michigan has moved to at least part of Phase 1c, the report said. For Phase 1b, CDC recommends vaccinating people age 75 and older and frontline essential workers and for Phase 1c, the agency recommends the vaccinations of people 65 and older, younger people with high-risk conditions and other essential workers.  States are \"making the decision to just get as many people vaccinated as they can,\" and bypassing recommendations for vaccine prioritization, said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee on Monday.  \"I think where people are right now is they have the vaccine and they just want to get it out there,\" Offit said.  Without the \"public health infrastructure for mass vaccination\" in place, states are having to learn how to manage mass vaccinations in real time, and some are learning quicker than others, he added.  How states are bolstering vaccine efforts  In at least 10 states, National Guard members are helping administer vaccines. Other states have asked dentists, retirees and students to aid in the process.  In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott toured a mass Covid-19 vaccination site Monday and said the state plans to open about 28 similar sites across 18 counties.  \"These vaccination hubs will expedite vaccine distribution and ensure efficiency in communities across the state,\" the governor said.  In California, 1 million health care workers, nursing home residents and staff will receive the vaccine by week's end, the governor promised Monday, as part of an \"all hands on deck\" push to serve the more vulnerable residents.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, meanwhile, sent a letter to Azar requesting permission to buy up to 100,000 doses of vaccines for the state.  \"We remain ready to accelerate distribution to get doses into arms,\" the governor said.  The letter comes after Whitmer and other state leaders urged government officials to distribute the vaccine doses that are currently being held back by the Trump administration. CDC to require all air travelers to US to show negative coronavirus test  The CDC announced Tuesday an order requiring all airline passengers entering the United States to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test before boarding flights to the US. \"Testing does not eliminate all risk,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement. \"But when combined with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations.\" This order will go into effect on January 26, the CDC said. The rule is similar to one put in place last month for passengers from the United Kingdom to the US, which requires that passengers have a negative test within three days of boarding their flight. For the UK requirement that went through last month, airlines can be subject to criminal penalties if they fail to comply, and passengers can be subject to criminal penalties if they willfully give false or misleading information. ", "\"Our expectation is that the vaccination should last you at least a year,\" Moderna's chief medical officer Tal Zaks told the JP Morgan 39th Annual Healthcare Conference. Both Moderna's and Pfizer/BioNTech's coronavirus vaccines have won emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Zaks said the company will have to test people to see if adding a third dose -- a boost -- might extend protection. Currently, the vaccine is given as two doses about a month apart. Because both vaccines were only invented within the past year, no one knows how long they'll protect people. \"We'll have to boost people to see how well the boost works,\" Zaks said. \"We think there is an opportunity to boost, especially the ones at high risk, should you need it.\"", "Baptist Health provided the Kentucky Department of Health with an online vaccine appointment scheduling tool that could be linked to the state's vaccine website for health care workers, Kit Fullenlove Barry, Baptist Health public relations manager, said in a statement to CNN Monday.  The state website linked to a page that outlined that vaccines are available for health care personnel as part of Phase 1a of the vaccine rollout. However, that information that was not included in the scheduling tool.  \"As a result, many who viewed the site mistakenly thought the vaccines were open to the general public, although we do not know how many people registered who might be ineligible at this time,\" Fullenlove Barry said in the statement.  Baptist Health sites have around 6,000 vaccination appointments scheduled over the next two weeks and the calendar is full. No additional appointments are being accepted at this time. Appointments made through the online system are still being honored in order to ensure those who are eligible receive a vaccine in a timely manner.   \"We continue to ask the community's help to ensure these vaccines reach our Commonwealth's healthcare personnel first so we can continue to provide needed care,\" the statement said.  \"Baptist Health has been working to provide a smooth process for cancellation for anyone who has scheduled a vaccination appointment in error, and will contact the 6,000 people who have registered for these appointments to provide that opportunity.\" Baptist Health said it will continue to partner with the state on vaccine rollout. \"We regret the confusion this has caused our communities and have updated the scheduling tool with the additional information.\"  Kentucky is in its first phase of vaccinations, which includes health care workers and those living in long-term and assisted care facilities. The state has administered 130,355 vaccine doses, according to numbers updated by the health department Monday. Kentucky has received 169,350 doses for the state vaccination program and 93,600 doses designated for long term care facilities.

", "Footage tweeted by the English language Siberian Times shows the 40-year-old woman from Moscow entering the carved-out section of a frozen Lake Baikal, before she started the underwater ice swim. Yekaterina Nekrasova, who took up free diving four years ago, then held her breath for a minute and a half as she covered the 85 meters (279 feet) of a frozen Lake Baikal on January 7 -- the Russian Orthodox Christmas Day. She is believed to have set a world record with her attempt. A spokeswoman for Guinness World Records told CNN they have received details of Nekrasova's attempt but have yet to verify the landmark swim.  Footage filmed from above the surface shows members of her support team following behind in wet suits, in case of emergency. According to the Siberian Times, holes were cut in the 10-inch-thick ice at regular intervals in case she needed to abort the swim. The challenge was filmed from both above and beneath the surface. Nekrasova can be seen descending a ladder, then following a route marked by a cable for a minute and a half. At the end she exits the water by climbing up another ladder.  Met by her support team, Nekrasova emerges to say in English: \"I'm OK.\"  Lake Baikal holds several global records itself. Somewhere between 20 and 25 million years old, it is the oldest existing freshwater lake on Earth. Reaching down as far as 5,315 feet, it is the deepest continental body of water, as well as being the world's largest freshwater lake by volume -- it holds about one-fifth of the fresh water on Earth's surface, some 5,500 cubic miles.  Posting on Russian social network site VK, Nekrasova said the original plan was to swim on January 6 but \"extreme weather\" -- including a \"very strong frost\" and stormy winds -- delayed it.   While she knew that she could \"comfortably\" swim 75 meters (246 feet), Nekrasova said doubts began to creep in. \"I thought what if I would freeze before the start, or the mask would freeze or fog up, or I would stick to the ice at the finish line. And of course I didn't know how long I could dive in a new place,\" she wrote.  The air temperature was as low as -22 degrees Fahrenheit but felt more like -43.6 on January 6, she said. Conditions were \"dangerous and dark under the ice,\" which convinced the team to postpone the attempt. Nekrasova described what happened the following day as a \"Christmas miracle.\"  \"The weather warmed up to -21 (degrees Celsius, -5.8 Fahrenheit ), the wind slightly moderated,\" she wrote. As her support team prepared the site with safety lanes and holes in the ice, she remained at her hotel.  Having warmed up, she made her way to the starting point, where she was joined by her support team. \"For a minute I stood dressed in front of the ladder, tuned in, breathing, the wind was strong. I put on a mask, undressed and hurried into the water. There is no wind, no frost, no fear in the water and it is very comfortable. I stood for about 30 seconds until the pulse calmed down. Then I dived.\" Describing the experience as a \"pleasure,\" said she \"enjoyed the process\" and that ultimately she was \"overwhelmed with emotions.\" Signing off, she added: \"The powerful energy of this place helped me. Thank you Baikal! Until next time!\" Ice swimming, or epiphany bathing, is a tradition in Russia. For many Orthodox Christians, it is part of a January ritual commemorating the baptism of Jesus. Nekrasova, who trains four times a week in a warm pool and dives twice in a week in ice holes in Moscow, told CNN: \"For me, under-ice diving is like an energy boost, as if I was reborn. It is a sensation I can't compare to anything else, a very pleasant one. And I always long for it.\"  Ram Barkai, the founder of the International Ice Swimming Association, told CNN he and a team of four Russian ice swimmers covered an above-surface \"ice mile\" in Lake Baikal at 40.1 degrees Fahrenheit back in 2017.  By comparison, Nekrasova is a free diver -- which means she held her breath for the duration of the swim at close to 32 degrees Fahrenheit, under a sheet of ice. He said: \"The water there is as fresh as one can get -- salinity of zero. Meaning you are heavier in the water and you feel the cold a little more than in salt water.  \"It is a magical place, Lake Baikal. The water visibility is also amazing, crystal clear water and you can see forever. That is a good factor for safety.\" Of Nekrasova's achievement, he said: \"The water should have been close to zero, which makes it extremely hard on your muscles. She swam without any assistance -- gliding very efficiently. It was amazing to watch her. \"Eighty-five meters is a very long distance in warm water with no ice sheet above your head. Although she had a line to show her direction and distance, she wasn't attached to anything, with few ice holes on the way. Typical hardcore Russian style.\" According to Guinness World Records, the record for the longest swim under ice is held by Dane Stig Severinsen, who swam 250 feet in Greenland in 2013. The record for the longest female swim under ice is 229.659 feet and was achieved by South African Amber Fillary in Oppsj\u00f8, Norway, on February 29, 2020.", "Rodman, 18, is the daughter of NBA legend and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member Dennis Rodman.  \"This has been my dream forever, I've been playing soccer since I was 4 years old,\" she said in an interview shortly after being drafted, with mother Michelle celebrating by her side. Rodman was due to play as a forward for Washington State University, yet her freshman collegiate season last fall was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. She has familial ties to the university; her brother, DJ, is a sophomore on Washington State's men's basketball team.   She said because of the pandemic, the timing worked out for her to turn toward her professional career. She added, \"Right now I think it's the perfect time to get in there and learn and become a better player.\" Rodman's selection Wednesday made league history, being the youngest woman ever selected in the NWSL draft.

In the CONCACAF championship game last March against Mexico, she scored two goals en route to a team victory and berth in the U-20 Women's World Cup.

It is unclear whether Keller has an attorney and whether he is in custody. CNN has been unable to contact Keller for comment. He is best known for anchoring the winning US team in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, in which he held off gold medalist Ian Thorpe of Australia.  Keller won four other medals at three Olympics, including gold in the same event in 2008 in Beijing. The court documents also say research showed Keller was identified by media outlets such as SwimSwam, which covers competitive swimming. FBI Special Agent Matthew R. Barofsky wrote in court documents that he confirmed Keller's identity by comparing photos he was in to his Colorado driver's license.  The photos from the Capitol also show Keller is wearing a US Olympic Team jacket and \"appears to be one of the tallest individuals,\" Barofsky writes in his statement of facts. Keller is 6 feet, 6 inches tall. In a statement, USA Swimming told CNN, \"We respect private individuals' and groups' rights to peacefully protest but in no way condone the actions taken by those at the Capitol last week.\" The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said it condemned the actions of the rioters. \"We support the right to peacefully protest and express values and viewpoints in a respectful and lawful manner -- that is what makes our democracy strong. Sadly, that is not what happened in this case,\" the organization said in a statement. Correction: A previous headline on this story incorrectly stated Keller's status. He has been charged and a warrant has been issued for his arrest. CNN has not confirmed whether he has been arrested. "], "world": ["The tourist boat had run out of wetsuits, but Ridley jumped in anyway to give his latest ambassador, conservationist and explorer David de Rothschild, a demonstration of his latest project. Ridley has form when it comes to asking people to perform simple tasks for the environment. In Sydney in 2007, he started Earth Hour -- the global \"lights out\" movement which asked whole cities to turn off non-essential lights for an hour on a designated day -- that has since spread to 188 countries.   Now, he and local scientists are asking people to take photos for the \"Great Reef Census,\" the biggest ever communal effort to map the world's largest reef system, that stretches 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) down the Queensland coast.  \"It is about reminding the world that this inspirational place is here and we need to do everything we can to keep it in the best shape possible,\" said Ridley, CEO of the non-profit Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef. The Citizens team has been testing the logistics of the census, and hope to finalize details in the next few months. \"It's got a lot of momentum,\" Ridley said. \"But it's still a crazy idea -- you know that, right?\"  Crisis meeting The idea for the census came in 2017. Ten severe tropical cyclones in 12 years had smashed parts of the reef, while the ravages of climate change -- rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification -- had left once vibrant coral communities bleached and fragile. At a conference in the northern city of Townsville, delegates were told the reef was in \"crisis.\"  They agreed \"dramatic\" change was needed in the way the Great Barrier Reef was managed if it was to survive. Ridley chatted with Peter Mumby, head of the Marine Spatial Ecology Lab at the University of Queensland, and Roger Beeden, the director of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. They needed to know more about the state of the reef, but were coming up short.  Long-term scientific monitoring had only collected detailed information on a small number of reefs -- not enough for marine park managers to form a cohesive response to climate change. \"If you want to understand where there are opportunities to respond after bleaching events, or to actually look after key areas, then we need to have information from a much greater number of reefs,\" Beeden said. \"To try to get that information ... you need to mobilize a huge workforce,\" Mumby said. \"(Scientists) don't have the resources and time to do that kind of survey.\" Ridley was looking for a project, Beeden and Mumby needed people, and so began discussions for the Great Reef Census.  How it will work  For several weeks late next year, anyone -- locals, tourists, fishermen, superyacht and other boat owners -- will be asked to take photos of the reef and upload them to an app. Then, anyone in the world with internet access will be invited to log on to help identify what's there.  You don't need to be a coral expert to become involved. Scientists say some of the most recognizable coral species are also the most important for reef restoration. \"That includes reefs that are dominated by these big plate-like corals, which are really important in stimulating recovery,\" Mumby said. \"Also, reefs that have what we're describing as monumental corals -- coral monuments -- which are exceptionally old, long-lived corals that have survived being damaged for one reason or another.\"  \"They're like the long, slow, old growth forests that we see in rainforests, the enormous trees,\" Beeden explained.  If scientists can identify the location of corals that naturally work to regenerate the reef, they can help protect them to give the reef the best chance it has to survive the climate crisis. \"As a reef manager, there's not much you can do to stop things warming up. (But) not everywhere warms up at the same rate. If you can map where that variation exists, and find those areas that are really important for recovery ... then you're strategically managing that recovery process as best you can,\" Mumby said. 'The reef is not dead' Ridley's Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef has been trying to get as many ambassadors onto the water as possible. Along with David de Rothschild, they've hosted model Jarrod Scott and the Australian Dolphins Swim Team.   Mumby bristles at the suggestion that the census is some kind of a publicity stunt. \"There's a very genuine scientific need for this information,\" Mumby said. \"We unashamedly want to have a different conversation about the reef globally, because at the moment the prevailing global conversation seems to be the reef is dead.\" News reports about the reef's demise spread worldwide in 2016 after Outside Magazine published a satirical obituary, horrifying scientists and creating a false perception that they've spent years trying to fix. \"It's deeply frustrating on a couple of fronts,\" Ridley said. \"When you get people believing that we've lost one of the world's greatest natural icons it doesn't inspire action, it actually inspires more apathy.\" Space the size of Italy  Maps of the reef are already being created using satellite images that can see to a depth of 20 meters in clear water. But they only provide a rough outline of the reef.  Details -- like the types of coral that are growing in a particular area -- are added later, when scientists refer to notes from field trips, or take an educated guess based on environmental conditions. \"From satellite imagery you can derive water depth. Water depth and wind creates waves and waves influence where coral types like to grow,\" explained Chris Roelfsema, co-director of the Remote Sensing Research Centre at the University of Queensland. This year, Roelfsema's team produced the first ever geomorphic map that shows the entire Great Barrier Reef system -- all 3,000 individual coral reefs. Photos from the reef census will be useful, he said, to help validate the geomorphic maps, and to fill the gaps where no data currently exists. Scientists are under no illusions about the size of the task ahead. \"The reason why this hasn't happened before is because it's a very large thing to do,\" said Beeden. \"A space the size of Italy with 3,000 reefs, many of which are actually very remote, presents some very substantial logistical challenges.\" Funding is required if the project is going to fulfill its potential to reach parts of the reef that have never been explored before. Ridley is talking with potential sponsors and hopes to announce a deal in January. He's confident the logistical challenges will be overcome and, by this time next year, scientists will have a much better idea of the state of the reef -- and most importantly, how to save it.  \"If we give up on something as amazing as the Great Barrier Reef,\" he says, \"and we think it's gone, and we're OK with that, what are we not OK with losing?\"", "", "No really, it can happen. Take Zuraina Zaharin from Malaysia. She's built a business off the back of a loo break. Not just any loo break, of course. This one was near Everest in the early 2000s when she was climbing in the region -- and it was pretty bleak. \"I was facing this problem: the toilet,\" she explains. \"It's easy for men to do their business; they can just do it anywhere. But not for the ladies. We have to wait until we find some nice spot. Even then, I can't do it. I just have to find the toilet.\" Things didn't improve upon discovering the facilities, however. \"The last toilet at Everest base camp is a pit latrine,\" Zaharin continues. \"The smell, God knows... it's so stinky.\" Zaharin had traveled to the Himalayas, only to encounter \"a mountain of poop.\" The problem hasn't exactly gone away. In 2018, 28,000 pounds of human waste was hauled from Everest base camp during the climbing season, according to a local NGO tasked with cleaning up Everest, and dumped in open pits where it risks entering the water supply system. It was an extreme example of unsafely managed sanitation -- something 4.5 billion people have to live with, according to the World Health Organization. Even flush toilets can bring their own problems, according to the UN, potentially \"increasing water stresses\" in countries with an inadequate water supply. Zaharin, an entrepreneur, adventurer and environmentalist, did not forget her Everest experience. When she attended a business forum in 2012 and listened to a man looking for investment in a sustainable toilet, ideal for locations with poor sanitation or little water, the stars aligned. Imad Agi from Sweden conceived a waterless toilet system that turns human waste into fertilizer without the harmful germs that can cause sickness if used in agriculture -- ideal for organic farming. Agi and Zaharin went into business together as co-founders of EcoLoo, refining the toilet and taking it to market. The toilet works by adding a microbe solution to the waste chamber. The microbes break down human solids -- normally in three to four days -- leaving behind \"ashes,\" while liquid waste is turned into liquid fertilizer, which can be extracted via an outlet, Zaharin explains. EcoLoo recommends the microbe solution is topped up once a month and costs $60 for a year's supply. EcoLoo claims it's less energy-intensive than a regular toilet because there's no waste water to separate and process. And before you ask, no, it doesn't smell, says Zaharin -- the bacterial process prevents bad odors from building in the tank. The toilet range, priced between $800-$2,500, has gone on to win a clutch of awards and sell over 2,000 units in 21 countries. Notable examples include units installed at Petra, the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Jordan. Zaharin says the EcoLoo could potentially play a role in disaster relief efforts when sanitation issues, often related to contaminated water supplies, cause diseases to spread rapidly. Of course, it's not the only waterless toilet on the block. Models have been around for decades in the developed world in one shape or form, incinerating, freezing or composting waste. But EcoLoo believes its low-energy product could have wide appeal. We're using 141 billion liters of fresh water globally every day to flush toilets -- six times the daily water consumption of the population of Africa -- per one recent study. Meanwhile, \"water stress is the biggest crisis no on is talking about,\" Andrew Steer, the head of the World Resources Institute, said earlier this year.  Diarrhea linked to inadequate sanitation causes an estimated 432,000 deaths every year, says the UN. The current climate seems ripe for less resource and energy-intensive toilets to become mainstream. Zaharin says her company has long since grown beyond its original purpose to serve rural communities. Luxury models and smaller units designed for transport and island holiday resorts are also on the market, she says. The EcoLoo co-founder still has one mountain to conquer: getting her toilet installed at Everest base camp. A plan to have one fitted was scuppered by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. But the dream lives on. \"Being an adventurer, I would never give up,\" she says. ", "From the outside, the agency may appear a monolith, but in reality, citizen scientists can play a substantial role -- perhaps none more so than in the ongoing Juno mission. Since 2016, the Juno spacecraft has circled Jupiter, scanning the atmosphere and mapping its magnetic and gravitational fields. It's also carrying JunoCam, a camera specifically designed to record images of the poles; areas of the gas giant not previously well documented. \"We do not have a formal imaging science team on Juno, so we have turned to the public to help us out,\" says Candice Hansen-Koharcheck, Juno co-investigator responsible for JunoCam. The amateur astronomy community assists with planning, she explains, determining when JunoCam should photograph the planet and where. Once images are sent back to Earth, the public has access to raw data, which, with a little photo editing know-how, have been processed into some of the most stunning images yet seen of Jupiter.  \"I don't know what we would do without them!\" says Hansen-Koharcheck. \"Over the past two years we have come to rely on them ... as important members of our virtual team.\" Among the most prolific and noted submitters are people working in the scientific community. Kevin Gill, a software engineer at The Jet Propulsion Lab, a NASA research and development center in California, works in data visualization and has dabbled in image processing professionally. But he creates JunoCam images for the love of science. Gill started in 2014 with photographs of Mars from Curiosity Rover and the HiRISE camera orbiting the red planet, before moving on to Cassini, which photographed Saturn and its moons, and other missions. Now he occupies his spare time with Juno. \"JunoCam is a wide-angle camera, but it's based off a black and white grayscale camera,\" he explains. The camera's sensor has filters for red, blue and green, and another for methane detection, capturing separate grayscale images for each. \"As the spacecraft is spinning, JunoCam will take a whole series of pictures ... up to 58 degrees wide and up to 360 degrees long,\" he adds. \"Juno will complete the perijove -- the closest point to Jupiter in its orbit -- and then it'll start transmitting the data.\" Image data takes a couple of days to reach Earth, then it's uploaded for public use. Gill has a semi-automated editing process, cleaning up any bad pixels or dust that may have hit the lens, before removing geometric distortion, then stitching the long, thin image strips together. To turn the composite image into color, he processes the red, green and blue grayscale images in image editing software, \"and, providing all the mapping is right, they will overlap perfectly.\" JunoCam cannot be fully calibrated for true color, says Gill, so there is a degree of creative license over the final image. \"I try to keep the color close,\" he says, while revealing \"what's more pleasing and more telling about what's on the surface.\" And what has Juno been able to see for the first time? \"We've been able to see cyclones up at the poles,\" he says. \"Finally, we have these really crisp images.\" Other personal highlights include Juno looking down into Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and recent findings from perijove 24. \"There's one system and it looks like a koi fish,\" Gill says. \"It's (an) orange cloud up in the Northern Hemisphere. I'm really excited to hear if they come up with a scientific explanation for it.\" Elsewhere, Gill is drawn to images of phenomena \"that are difficult to answer\": red, scratch-like stripes on Tethys, the equatorial mountain range on Iapetus and signs of faint rings orbiting Rhea -- all moons of Saturn photographed by Cassini. Gill believes photography can bring us closer to our planetary neighbors -- sometimes to the point of incredulity. \"When I use HiRISE imagery,\" he says, \"they're taken from orbit and they'll also publish elevation models. I can process those and create a panorama as if you were standing on the ground... You get people commenting saying, 'No, you're lying, that's Arizona, or Utah. I saw that hill!'\" Designed to withstand at least seven orbits, JunoCam is still operational after 26 trips around Jupiter, with the promise of more photography to come. The mission has already been extended once and the team behind it is exploring extending it further, says Hansen-Koharcheck. But there's other ambitious NASA missions on the horizon, says Gill, with a potential trove of photography for public perusal.  Mars 2020, a rover that will be dropped at the site of an ancient lake, will be equipped with no less than 23 cameras. Europa Clipper will investigate Jupiter's icy moon, passing within 16 miles of what NASA says \"may be the best place to look for extraterrestrial life in the solar system.\" More ambitious still, the Dragonfly mission aims to fly a rotocopter above the surface of Saturn's moon Titan, \"an analog to the very early Earth,\" according to NASA. Patience is key, however. \"Clipper and Dragonfly are a little way off -- they're in the 2030s -- but I'm still looking forward to the imagery we get back from those,\" says Gill.", ""], "entertainment": ["Born and raised in the Smoky Mountains, she's waxed poetic about her \"Tennessee mountain home\" in her recordings. She donated $1 million to Vanderbilt University Medical Center that helped develop a coronavirus vaccine. The state's equivalent of Disney World even bears her name.  It's fitting, then, that she be honored with a statue in front of the Tennessee Capitol.  Earlier this week, Tennessee Rep. John Mark Windle proposed erecting a statue of Parton that will sit on the state Capitol grounds \"to recognize her for all she has contributed to this state.\" If it's commissioned, the Parton sculpture will face the historic Ryman Auditorium, a music venue where she's played throughout her career. If approved, the statue would be paid for by the \"Dolly Parton fund,\" which would include gifts, grants and other donations. The public would have a say in the statue's design, too, according to Windle's bill. CNN has reached out to Windle for comment and is waiting to hear back.  A sculpture of Parton would be a decidedly less controversial addition to the Tennessee State Capitol, which housed Confederate monuments.  In June 2020, state historians moved to remove a bust of Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan member Nathan Bedford Forrest from the Capitol and relocate it off the grounds, but state lawmakers have opposed the move, the Tennessean reported.

Said android -- a next-generation biotech prototype -- is Leo (Mackie), who has requested help from a drone pilot named Harp (\"Snowfall's\" Damson Idris) to thwart insurgents seeking nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe. The two head out into a perilous militarized zone on their mission, where the vaguely defined threat allows for a lot of violence that's part war movie, part espionage thriller. Harp, who is introduced getting in trouble for defying direct orders, seems understandably confused why he's been drafted for this James Bond-style exercise, but Leo assures him, \"I'm special enough for both of us.\" Still, other than revealing that he's different when his shirt comes off, nothing about Leo feels particularly artificial, superhuman or android-y. Yes, there's a lot of shooting and jumping and fighting, but other than the deployment of more conventional robot soldiers, those waiting for Leo to do something fantastic will likely come away disappointed -- Mackie basically plays him as a tough guy in a bad mood -- leaving behind pretty standard action material. The vibe is thus closer to a buddy action movie (the squabbling pairs are often somehow mismatched) than something like \"Robocop,\" which is what the description brings to mind. The ostensible villain and supporting cast -- including \"House of Cards'\" Michael Kelly as Harp's commander -- proves mostly an afterthought. Directed by Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m, \"Outside the Wire\" can charitably be compared to the kind of \"B\" movies that studios used to churn out, and is best consumed by tempering expectations accordingly. Because unlike its futuristic hero, there's nothing special about it. \"Outside the Wire\" premieres Jan. 15 on Netflix. "]}
